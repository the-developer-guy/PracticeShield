# 0006-variable-directional-spinner

Make the LEDs spin in circles, with adjustable speed and direction.

## Task

Configure digital pins 2 through 9 as outputs, and control the LEDs to spin in a circle with adjustable speed and direction.

## Explanation

This example demonstrates controlling multiple GPIO pins to create a spinning LED effect with adjustable speed and direction.

Each LED (connected to digital pins 2 through 9) can be turned on or off individually. A potentiometer and a switch control the speed and direction of the spinning effect.
